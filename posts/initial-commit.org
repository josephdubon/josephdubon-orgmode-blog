* initial-commit.post

** Totally Awesome (like the movie!)
+ *This is pretty radical.*
Been meaning to launch a bare-bones dev blog for a long time.
Very excited to get this going and launched.

** Emacs / Org-mode
+ This time around I am using *emacs* and *org-mode* to /write/ & /publish/ my posts.

*** /Why?/
+ Because I fu%%$ng can!!
+ ...and emacs rules!
+ simplicity and *purism*
*** Python, Django, M1 problems, Emacs, System Config...
+ ...and so many more cool things.

** Muchas Gracias
+ Thanks for your time!
+ Next post soonish.
